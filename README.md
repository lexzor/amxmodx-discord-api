# amxmodx-discord-api

A library for AMX Mod X that provides Discord API functionality to AMXX plugins.

It uses D++ (DPP) as the underlying C++ library to interface with Discord, exposing convenient natives that plugin developers can call directly from their AMXX scripts.

This allows you to integrate Discord features—such as sending messages, managing channels, or responding to events—directly within your AMXX plugins without needing to implement the Discord protocol from scratch or use another virtual machine to host the Discord bot.
